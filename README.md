## How to open the file

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and navigate the folder you saved this project in.


## Purpose of the website

1. This has a list of restaurants by cuisine and location. A map is provided, along with filer options for cuisine and location. Click on either the 'view details' button for the restaurant or the marker indicated on the map to continue to the next page.

2. This page has a map with only one marker, showing where the indicated restaurant is you've selected. On the left side, you can scroll down to find all information you should need about the restaurant.

3. There are several links available on the second page to get you back to the first if the option you selected is not adequate.
